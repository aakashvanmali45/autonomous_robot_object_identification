# Chain Wheeled Mobile Robot with IR Camera for Object Identification

## Overview
Developed an autonomous robot equipped with an IR camera for object identification.

## Features
- Designed a detailed CAD model using Autodesk Fusion 360 and converted it into a URDF file.
- Integrated the robot model into Gazebo simulation environment.
- Added essential plugins for:
  - IR camera sensor
  - LIDAR sensor
  - Skid steering mechanism
- Implemented autonomous driving behavior using LIDAR data.
- Used the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for object identification.
- Created a custom Gazebo world to test and validate the robot's performance.
- Executed the full project using Robot Operating System (ROS).
